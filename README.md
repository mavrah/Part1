Compiling the Software:

Open the Visual Studio project files included in the source code zip file.
In Visual Studio, ensure that the project is set to build in the "Release" configuration.
Build the project by clicking on the "Build" menu and selecting "Build Solution".
Running the Software:

After the successful build, navigate to the output directory where the executable file is located. This is typically in a subdirectory named "bin/Release".
Run the executable file to start the recipe application.
When the application starts, you will see the following menu options:

Enter a new recipe
Display the current recipe
Scale the recipe
Reset the recipe quantities
Clear the recipe
Exit
Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the recipe application and perform the desired operations.

Remember, the application does not persist the user data between runs, so any entered recipes will be lost when the application is closed.
